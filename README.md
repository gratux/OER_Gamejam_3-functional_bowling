## What are open educational recourses (OER)?
Open educational resources (OER) are teaching, learning, and research materials intentionally created and licensed to be free for the end user to own, share, and in most cases, modify it. [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources).

The vision is to enable lecturers to reuse, adopt and improve it and in such a way create impact in education.

## What is a game jam?
A gamejam is like a hackathon a gettogether of talented, motivated game developer/artists and/or enthusiasts which work together in a short time span to create a video / computer game from scratch.
Gamejams - especially when done in real life - are a really cool way to work together, motivate contributors and create something beautiful in a short and effective time span.

## What is an OER game jam?
We want to combine open source with game development to improve education and thus organise OER gamejams which focus on the development of small minigames that have an educational value.
Didactic and game experts are brought together and co-create educational games which can be used adopted or reinvented in the next jam - the jam must go on :)
